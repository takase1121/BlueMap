## Don't Look Here!

This is a fork of BlueMap that supports various experimental features, such as WebP support, better PNG for low resolution tiles, and brotli support.
My goal is to reduce Internet bandwidth when loading the map and reducing the map size on disk.
These changes will **never be upstreamed, and I will not maintain them**.

##### Branches

- `feature/webp`: uses WebP to compress lowres tiles, which reduces the map size very slightly (can cause crashes)
- `feature/better-png`: uses a faster PNG encoder for lowres tiles (not that fast and not that efficient either)
- `feature/brotli`: uses brotli to compress hires tiles which reduces their size by 20% (requires HTTPS; significant slowdown expected)
- `special`: based on `feature/better-png` and `feature/brotli`

In short, these are neither good for normal use. Just use upstream.

## What is BlueMap
BlueMap is a program that reads your Minecraft world files and generates not only a map, but also 3D-models of the whole surface.
With the web-app you then can look at those in your browser and basically view the world as if you were ingame! 
Or just look at it from far away to get an overview.

BlueMap comes as a Spigot/Paper or Sponge Plugin, as a Fabric or Forge-Mod and you can also use BlueMap without any Server
from the Command-Line as a standalone tool.

If installed as a Plugin/Mod, BlueMap **renders asynchronously** to your MinecraftServer-Thread. 
This means at no time it will block your server-thread directly. 
So as long as your CPU is not fully utilized, your server should not be slowed down while BlueMap is rendering.


## Using BlueMap
You can download BlueMap from [here](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/releases).
